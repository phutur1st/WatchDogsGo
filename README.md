# Watch Dogs Go

> **Work in progress:** The Discord Remote plugin (`plugins/discord_remote.py`) is under active development — features and commands may change.

Open-world hacking RPG with real cybersecurity tooling. A pyxel game frontend for the ESP32-C5 security device, inspired by Watch Dogs aesthetics.

### Quick Install (uConsole / Raspberry Pi OS / Debian)

```bash
curl -sL https://locosp.github.io/WatchDogsGo/install | sudo bash
```

The installer clones the repo to `~/python/esp32-watch-dogs/`, creates a Python virtual environment, installs all dependencies, and adds a desktop launcher.

> **Optimized for [ClockworkPi uConsole](https://www.clockworkpi.com/uconsole)** — runs on 640x360 display at 30 FPS. Designed for field use with integrated hardware modules.

### First Run

After installation:

```bash
cd ~/python/esp32-watch-dogs
sudo ./run.sh
```

Or double-click **Watch Dogs Go** on your desktop.

**On first launch the game will:**

1. Load player profile (XP, level, badges) from `loot/loot_db.json`
2. Auto-detect ESP32 on `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0` (no serial = "ESP32 not found", that's OK to test the UI)
3. Try to open GPS on `/dev/ttyAMA0` (uConsole AIO) or USB GPS — optional
4. Discover and load plugins from `plugins/` (currently: Wars Sync, JanOS Loot Import)
5. Show the cyberdeck UI

**You don't need any API keys to start.** Wars Sync (community server upload) is locked until level 6 (WARDRIVER, 6000 XP) — until then you can play offline.

If you want to use the community server (wdgwars.pl), edit `secrets.conf`:

```bash
cp secrets.conf.example secrets.conf
nano secrets.conf
```

### What gets installed

The installer pulls these system packages (Debian/Ubuntu):

- `python3-venv`, `libsdl2-dev`, `libsdl2-image-dev` — for pyxel game engine
- `tcpdump`, `aircrack-ng`, `iw` — for MITM and Dragon Drain attacks
- `rtl-433` — for RTL-SDR 433 MHz sensor decoding
- `dump1090` — ADS-B; built from [flightaware/dump1090](https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090)
  since the Debian `dump1090-mutability` package has been archived upstream
  since 2018 and no longer supports RTL-SDR v4 tuners
- `bluez`, `bluez-tools`, `pulseaudio-utils` — for BLE attacks
- `python3-rpi-lgpio` — GPIO library for Raspberry Pi 5 / CM5
- `python3-gi`, `gir1.2-glib-2.0` — BlueZ pairing agent (PipBoy watch MITM)

And these Python packages (in `.venv`):

- `pyxel` — retro game engine
- `pyserial` — ESP32 serial communication
- `Pillow` — sprite generation
- `scapy`, `netifaces` — packet manipulation (MITM, Dragon Drain)
- `bleak`, `dbus-python` — BLE attacks (RACE, BLE HID)
- `LoRaRF`, `cryptography`, `PyNaCl` — LoRa MeshCore radio

### Known platform notes

- **Linux only** — macOS and Windows are not supported.
- **Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm/Trixie**: requires `python3-rpi-lgpio` (auto-installed). Older `RPi.GPIO` from pip doesn't work on RPi5/CM5.
- **Generic Linux**: Pyxel requires SDL2 system libraries. The installer handles Debian/Ubuntu automatically; for Fedora/Arch/Alpine you'll need to install SDL2 manually.
- **dialout group**: Your user must be in `dialout` group for ESP32 serial access without sudo. If you see "permission denied" on serial:
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
  ```
  Then log out and back in.

## Hardware Requirements

### Required

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **ClockworkPi uConsole** | Primary platform (or any Linux with pyxel-compatible display) |
| **ESP32-C5** | Running [projectZero](https://github.com/LOCOSP/projectZero) firmware — WiFi/BLE scanning, deauth, handshake capture, Evil Twin, BLE HID |
| **GPS module** | AIO v2 GPS on `/dev/ttyAMA0` (or USB GPS) — real-time positioning, wardriving logs, map tracking |

### Optional (for full functionality)

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **External WiFi adapter** (monitor mode) | Required for **Dragon Drain** (WPA3 SAE flood). Recommended: **Alfa Network AWUS036ACH** or **AWUS036ACM** |
| **LoRa SX1262 module** | AIO v2 LoRa — packet sniffing, MeshCore mesh scanning, Meshtastic, APRS balloon tracking |
| **Flipper Zero** | USB-connected — SubGHz RX/TX, NFC read/emulate, signal replay from SD card |

> Attacks marked with a red **!** triangle in the menu require an external WiFi adapter with monitor mode support.

### AIO v2 module (uConsole only)

If you have a [HackerGadgets AIO v2](https://github.com/hackergadgets/aiov2_ctl)
module plugged into your uConsole, the game can toggle GPS / LoRa / SDR / USB
power rails on demand from the SYSTEM menu. This is what makes the "GPS [g]",
"LoRa [l]", "SDR [d]" and "USB [b]" entries actually do something.

To enable AIO v2 control you need **two** things on the system:

1. **`pinctrl`** — already present on Raspberry Pi OS (provided by the `raspi-utils`
   package). Verify with `command -v pinctrl`. The game uses `pinctrl set/get`
   directly to flip the GPIO pins — this is faster and more reliable than going
   through the full `aiov2_ctl` subprocess chain at runtime.

2. **`aiov2_ctl`** — official AIO v2 control tool from HackerGadgets. Used by
   the game for hardware presence detection and first-time rail setup, and
   independently provides a CLI + system tray GUI. Install it with the
   official method:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pyqt6 git
   git clone https://github.com/hackergadgets/aiov2_ctl.git
   cd aiov2_ctl
   sudo python3 ./aiov2_ctl.py --install
   ```
   This installs `aiov2_ctl` to `/usr/local/bin` and enables the
   `aiov2-rails-boot.service` systemd unit so the rails come up at boot.

   The game's `setup.sh` will run these steps automatically on uConsole-class
   hardware (when `pinctrl` is present), and the in-game SYSTEM menu also
   offers an "Install aiov2_ctl" action if it isn't found.

Without these the game still runs fine, the AIO toggles just become no-ops
and their state always shows `OFF` in the SYSTEM tab.

## What It Is

## Attack Details

### Dragon Drain (WPA3 SAE Flood)

Exploits CVE-2019-9494. Sends spoofed SAE Commit frames to overwhelm the target AP's elliptic curve computation, causing denial of service. Runs entirely on uConsole using scapy — does not use ESP32 serial. **Requires external WiFi adapter in monitor mode** (e.g., Alfa AWUS036ACH).

### MITM (ARP Spoofing)

Full man-in-the-middle attack with dedicated JanOS-style sub-screen:

1. **Idle** — attack description and info
2. **Interface selection** — auto-detect or pick from list
3. **Target mode** — single IP, scan subnet + select, or all devices
4. **Confirmation dialog** — shows victims, gateway, interface
5. **Running** — live scrolling log: DNS queries (cyan), HTTP requests (green), credentials (red)

Saves full pcap to `loot/<session>/mitm/`. Restores ARP tables on stop.

### BlueDucky (BLE HID Injection)

Exploits CVE-2023-45866 for unauthenticated Bluetooth HID pairing. Scans for BLE devices, pairs without user confirmation, and injects keystrokes. Includes Rick Roll payload.

### RACE Attack (Airoha BT Exploit)

Targets Airoha, Sony, and TRSPX Bluetooth SoCs (CVE-2025-20700/20701/20702). Extracts link keys and device info via GATT debug interface.

## MeshCore Messenger

Background mesh chat over LoRa SX1262 (869.618 MHz). Auto-starts with LoRa toggle in SYSTEM — sends advert to mesh network so messages can be received immediately. Closing the chat (ESC) keeps MeshCore running in background.

- **Fullscreen chat** with scrollable message history
- **Multi-channel support** — public, hashtag (#name), and private channels
- **Heard Nodes panel** — [H] shows discovered nodes with type, RSSI, SNR, age
- **Channel picker** — [C] to select active TX channel, [/] quick-switch
- **Speech bubbles** on map with CB radio sprite when messages arrive
- **Toast notifications** — always-on-top across all screens with sound
- **Node discovery** with GPS coordinates saved to loot (dedup by node ID)
- **Persistent config** — node name + channels saved to `~/.janos_meshcore.json`
- **Random node name** — auto-generated `WatchDogs-XXXXXX` on first run
- **LoRa HUD status** in bottom bar (in line with GPS info)

### Messenger Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `A-Z`, `0-9` | Type message |
| `ENTER` | Send message on active channel |
| `A` | Send advert (broadcast presence) |
| `N` | Change node name (persistent) |
| `H` | Toggle Heard Nodes panel |
| `C` | Open channel picker |
| `[` / `]` | Quick-switch channels |
| `X` | Clear chat log |
| `PgUp` / `PgDn` | Scroll history |
| `ESC` | Back to map (MeshCore stays active) |

## LoRa Features

Requires SX1262 module on AIO v2 (`/dev/spidev1.0`).

| Feature | Frequencies | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| MeshCore Messenger | 869.618 MHz | Background mesh chat with auto-advert, speech bubbles on map |

## Map

- **Coastlines**: Natural Earth 50m data (~2200 points)
- **Tile rendering**: downloadable OSM map tiles for detailed street-level view
- **Map Downloader**: SYSTEM > Download Map fetches OpenStreetMap tiles in a ~10 km radius around current GPS position (or map center without fix). Progress shown in terminal. Press again to cancel. Tiles saved to `maps/` for offline use.
- **14 zoom levels**: from WORLD (360deg) to CLOSE-UP (0.02deg)
- **Markers**: green = WiFi loot, cyan = BT loot, red = handshake, yellow = MeshCore
- **Radar**: top-right corner, real-time device positions
- **GPS tracking**: auto-centers on live position when fix available

## GPS

Reads NMEA from `/dev/ttyAMA0` (AIO v2) or auto-detects USB GPS.

Status in bottom HUD:
- **Left**: LoRa ON/OFF status
- **Right**: GPS status — `Waiting for GPS fix` / `Waiting fix Vis:N` / `51.1234N 17.9876E`

Without GPS: arrow keys for manual pan.

## Configuration Files

| File | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `secrets.conf` | Project root | WPA-sec + WiGLE + WDGoWars API keys |
| `.watchdogs_meshcore.json` | `~/` | MeshCore node name + channels |
| `.watchdogs_meshcore_key` | `~/` | Ed25519 keypair for MeshCore signing |
| `loot_db.json` | `loot/` | Aggregate stats, XP, badges |
| `last_run.log` | `~/.watchdogs/` | Game log (rotated to `previous_run.log`) |

## Troubleshooting & Bug Reports

The game writes a full log to `~/.watchdogs/last_run.log` on every launch
(rotated to `previous_run.log` on next start). It contains:

- A clearly-marked `=== SESSION START ===` block with diagnostic info
  (OS, hardware model, Python version, detected USB serial devices,
  game version, display environment)
- All log messages from game subsystems (serial, GPS, LoRa, plugins)
- Full Python tracebacks for any unhandled exception, captured before
  the process dies

### Reporting a bug

The fastest way — let the game format the report for you:

```bash
sudo -u $USER python3 -m watchdogs --bugreport > /tmp/wdg-bug.md
cat /tmp/wdg-bug.md   # review it (no API keys, no GPS, just diagnostics)
```

Then open [a new issue](https://github.com/LOCOSP/esp32-watch-dogs/issues/new),
paste the contents of `wdg-bug.md`, and add:

1. **What you tried to do** (one sentence)
2. **What happened instead** (one sentence)
3. **Was the game running before the bug?** Yes / no / hard to say

You can also do it manually if you prefer — just open
`~/.watchdogs/last_run.log`, scroll to the most recent
`=== SESSION START — copy from here for bug reports ===` marker, copy
everything from that line to the end, and paste it into your issue
inside a triple-backtick code block.

### Common issues

**Game won't start, "ImportError: pyxel"** — re-run setup:
```bash
cd ~/python/esp32-watch-dogs && bash setup.sh
```

**"Permission denied" on /dev/ttyUSB0** — your user is not in the
`dialout` group:
```bash
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
# log out and back in (or reboot)
```

**ESP32 not detected** — check `lsusb` for one of: CP2102, CH340,
FTDI, or Espressif USB-JTAG. The game logs all USB serial devices it
sees in the diagnostic block.

**MeshCore radio stays "OFF"** — make sure `meshtasticd` is not
holding the SPI bus:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop meshtasticd
sudo systemctl disable meshtasticd
```
The launcher does this automatically on every start, but only if the
service is installed.

**HTTPS errors when uploading to wdgwars.pl** — check `~/.watchdogs/last_run.log`
for SSL errors. Most often caused by an expired system CA bundle:
```bash
sudo apt-get install --reinstall ca-certificates
```

**"Invalid API key (401)"** when adding your wdgwars.pl key — copy
the key from your profile page on the portal exactly (64 hex chars,
no quotes, no spaces).

## Community contributions

The game is built around a real ESP32-C5 + AIO v2 setup, but the
community has worked out alternative paths for hardware that doesn't
match exactly. These live as opt-in tools maintained by their authors
— not bundled in this repo, not part of our `setup.sh`, no
maintenance commitment from us. Use at your own risk.

- **ESP32-less wardriving on uConsole AIO v1** —
  [`wdg_wifi_bridge.py`](https://github.com/LOCOSP/WatchDogsGo/issues/3)
  by [@FusedStamen](https://github.com/FusedStamen). Emulates the
  projectZero serial protocol over a PTY (`/tmp/esp32-pty`) using the
  host's own WiFi (via `iw`) and Bluetooth (via `bleak`) adapters; the
  game opens it like a normal ESP32 thanks to the char-device argv
